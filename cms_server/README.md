# CMS Mock Server

This is a mock implementation of the **Customer Management System (CMS)** for the Swift Logistics project.  
It simulates a SOAP/XML web service that exposes a minimal set of customer-related operations, allowing developers to integrate and test against a predictable backend without relying on the real CMS.
